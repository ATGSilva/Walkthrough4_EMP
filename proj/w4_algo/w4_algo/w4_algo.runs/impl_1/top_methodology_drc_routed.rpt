Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks axi_clk and ipbus_clk (see constraint position 81 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).

TIMING-47#3 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks clk_payload_pseudo and ipbus_clk (see constraint position 81 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to cover synchronous clock domains with constraints that prevent timing analysis as the design could fail in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#4 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks ipbus_clk and axi_clk (see constraint position 81 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to cover synchronous clock domains with constraints that prevent timing analysis as the design could fail in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#5 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks ipbus_clk and clk_40_pseudo (see constraint position 81 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to cover synchronous clock domains with constraints that prevent timing analysis as the design could fail in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#6 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks ipbus_clk and clk_payload_pseudo (see constraint position 81 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to cover synchronous clock domains with constraints that prevent timing analysis as the design could fail in hardware.

XDCB-3#1 Warning
Same clock mentioned in multiple groups in the same set_clock_groups command  
The same clock(s) mentioned in more than one group within the same set_clock_groups constraint: ipbus_clk
This is not a valid scenario and should be corrected.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option 'objects : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~infra/dma/xdma/*/phy_clk_i/bufg_gt_userclk/O}]' of constraint 'create_generated_clock' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '74' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

CLKC-40#1 Advisory
Substitute PLLE4 for MMCME4 check  
The MMCME4 cell infra/clocks/mmcm has a single input clock whose source driver, BUFG_GT infra/dma/xdma/inst/pcie4_ip_i/inst/gt_top_i/diablo_gt.diablo_gt_phy_wrapper/phy_clk_i/bufg_gt_userclk, is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell infra/clocks/mmcm CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) infra/dma/xdma/inst/pcie4_ip_i/inst/gt_top_i/diablo_gt.diablo_gt_phy_wrapper/phy_clk_i/bufg_gt_userclk and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#2 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell ttc/clocks/mmcm CLKIN1 and CLKIN2 pins are driven by global Clock buffer(s) infra/osc_clock/bufg_40ext, infra/clocks/bufgaux and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
